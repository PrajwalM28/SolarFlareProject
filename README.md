# SolarFlareProject

# Description
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project focused on predicting solar flares using machine learning techniques. The objective of this project is to create a reliable predictive model capable of forecasting solar flares, which are rapid and powerful bursts of energy originating from the Sun's surface. Accurately predicting these solar events can improve our comprehension of solar dynamics and help reduce their effects on Earth's technological infrastructure.
